    "\n",
    "Ans: There are several reasons that functions are advantageous in your program:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to write a block of code that can be reused multiple times in your program without having to write the same code over and over again. This can save a lot of time and effort, and also helps to reduce the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularization: Functions help you to break down a large and complex program into smaller, more manageable parts. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using functions in your program can make your code more efficient, modular, maintainable and easier to understand."
